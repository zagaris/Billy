=====================================================

A demo application for a simple URL shortener service


## How it works




## Quick Start

Clone the repo and install the dependencies.

```bash
https://github.com/zagaris/Billy.git
cd Billy/server
```

```bash
npm install
```
To start the express server, run the following

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) and take a look around.

## Testing
You can run tests via npm:

```
$ npm test
```

**or**

```
$ npm run test
```

The latter command will execute all tests automatically whenever a change is detected.
